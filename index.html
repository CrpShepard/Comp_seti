                    <p class="mainText">Sabaton is a Swedish heavy metal band from Falun. Most of their nine albums are written about war. Their latest album The Great War (2019) reached number 1 on Swedish and German music charts. Sabaton has been referred to as one of the "big four" power metal bands, along with Helloween, Blind Guardian and DragonForce.[1] They are one of the most successful rock bands in Swedish history, and their album Carolus Rex is the best-selling Swedish heavy metal album of all time.</p>

                    <p class="mainText">The band released in March 2005 an "Primo Victoria" their second album. Joakim Broden, lead vocals of the band, said "that album kicked off". The band has amassed a loyal army of European followers -- they have their own annual festival and cruise -- and released a slew of acclaimed albums. The band became increasingly successful across Europe, as witnessed on 2011's live album, World War Live: Battle of the Baltic Sea, featuring a dozen tracks and ten different countries. The following year's Carolus Rex hit number one in Sweden and Poland.</p>
